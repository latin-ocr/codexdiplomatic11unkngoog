bearing the second name, but that it is uncertain
whether the places are the same.

Lastly, where the modern name is printed in italic
character, it marks an attempt to suggest the name
which may be borne by a corresponding place in the
same county. Thus, when I write

Achangra, 1⁰94.
Oakhanger, Hants,

I intend to say that Achangra was in Hampshire, and
that if there is any corresponding place in that county,
it is now 'probably known by the name of Oakhanger,
but that I have no means of knowing whether there is
such a place or not.

It is obvious that the local knowledge of those
whose opportunities favour such investigations‚ will
find its best field in this class of names, The sug-

’ gestions are founded upon the analogies of other

nameS‚ and the well-ascertained rules of change which
Anglosaxon words in general manifest in their gra-
dual declension into English, still this is at the best-
an uncertain portion of my labour‚ and probably is
full of errorS. By printing it in a different type 1
have endeavour-ed to guard the reader from accepting
what seem probabilities to me for ascertained facts;
but experience has shewn that these guesses are some·
times fortunate τ. since the index was begua, many
words have been removed from the fourth into the
second claSS, and it is to be hoped that many more
may yet be found worthy of a similar transposition.
