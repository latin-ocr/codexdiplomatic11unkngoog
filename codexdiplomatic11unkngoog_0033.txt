and care have greatly lightened the toils of editing,
and who have dealt in a most satisfactory manner
with a work which presented difficulties of no ordi-
nary character.

Some time will probably elapse before another
volume of these Charters can be offered to the public :
it is to be hoped‚ that, in libraries yet unransacked, in
family archives yet unvisited, and in episcopal regis-
ters which have not yet been duly searched, similar
materials for our early law and history lurk unre-
cognized, aud that at some future period these will be
brought to light, and supply us with the materials for
a further Collection. I will venture to suggest to
the owners of such archives, that nothing could add
more to the value of th'eir libraries than the discovery
of ancient documentS‚ such as these Saxon Charters3
and it is possible that some are yet to be found
among the muniments of those corporations or fami-
lies which became the possessors of church-lands and
property at the period of the Reformation. Expe-
rience has taught me, that even in collections which
have been carefully arranged, and are duly treasured,
fortunate diligence may meet with unexpected re-
wards3 what then may not be expected from a care,-
sul enquiry in repositories which have not been
arranged and searched with equal labour ‘t ln the
meantime it will be my care to prepare other Indexes
which may aid the student who desires to use these
documents for historical purposes, and to render as
perfect as I can the lists of KingS‚ BishopS, Dukes,

and Abbots‚ and the general Fasti of the Anglo- .

saxon kingdoms ε these tables, if they should prove to
be executed with accuracy, and on a comprehensive
scale, will not fail to be of service to all who take an

interest in the antiquities of the English Common-
wealth.
