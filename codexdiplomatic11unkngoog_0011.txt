recited verbatim in the body of the new one. Many
of these are found in the Exchequer, in the office of
the King’s Remembrancer, a few only, in the Rolls
of the Tower3 a few are on single sheets of vel·-
lum, as they may have been made out for the re·

which have been entered into ChartularieS, or bookS,
belonging to the monasteries, and preserved hy them
as title deeds, chartei-s of privilege and immunity, and
either as evidences of property, or rank, precedence,

sheets might be mislaid or worn out, if too frequently
produced for the inspection of either friends or foes;
a digested copy of all the land-titles was easier to use,
and tended to secure the safety of the originaIS.
From time to time these Registers or Chartularies
were recopied, and, for the most part translated in
recopying into the form of speech current at the later
period; they thus offer to the scientific philologist a
mass of data upon which inquiries into the progress
and changes of language can be most securely founded.
In many cases they have preserved to us copies of
charters whose originals are no longer found ;⁴ a'nd as
¹they have also preserved copies of many which we
possess in their first and oldest form, they supply the
means of comparison and induction as to the genuine-
ness of others for which we have no authority but
their own. v

It appears likely to be of some service, if 1 here give
a list of the manuscripts and printed books which have

been used in the compilation of the work, accompanied ·

by a short notice of such authorities as appear de-

serving of remark. It will be seen that the number

and variety of these authorities is very great3 and it

may fairly be hoped that the very fact of their being
