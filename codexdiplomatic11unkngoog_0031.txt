These are the principal sources from which the
contents of the preceding volumes have been taken,
and it requires only a glauce to convince any impar-
tial person, how difficult it would have been to make
any use of the charters while they remained dispersed
in so many different repositories. This difficulty was
greatly enhanced by the confused manner in which
the documents are heaped together in the registers
and chartularios, where no chronological order is ever
thought of. Moreover, of the whole number of docu-
mentS, about a fourth, and the boundaries of nearly
all, are written in Anglosaxon, a language which is
not sufficiently cultivated in England now, but which
was still more neglected by the early Norman tran-
scribers: to the difficulty then of non-access was
added that arising from the careless writing of igno-
rant copyists. On all these groundS, therefore, it was
much to be desii-ed that a complete collection should
be made, arranged in order of time, and in which the
errors of the copyists should be corrected, as far as
our present state of knowledge permitted. This I
have attempted to accomplish3 and though I am only
too well aware how far removed from faultless the
execution of the work has proved, I am not without
hope that it will still be found no trifling boon to the

legal antiquary and the philologist.
