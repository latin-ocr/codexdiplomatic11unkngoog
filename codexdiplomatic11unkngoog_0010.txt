quiet deserves to be studied, as well as envied, by our
neighbours.

More than fifteen hundred documents have survived
the conquests and tramplings of armieS, the storm of
revolutionS, the yet more efficient and gradual changes
of fashion, and the altered forms of public and private
life; they have survived not only to show us what
our forefathers thought and did, but to prove the

long been unintelligible, should still remain, after
eight hundred years of interval, for our contempla-

facts they teach.

The repositories in which they have been preserved

caseS, those of private collectors. Many are yet ex-

and such a charter, in manner and form following,
and that he confirmed it. From the words used, this
confirmation is called an impooeimus in England, a
vidimus on the continent, and the ancient chat-ter is
